# Covid 19-Vaccination-progress-Anaysis-by-R
Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that can cause respiratory tract infection in humans ranging from mild symptoms to lethal outcomes. Until now, there are seven genera of coronaviruses that are known to infect humans.SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus that causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been the most challenging pandemic in this century. Considering its high mortality and rapid spread, an effective vaccine is urgently needed to control this pandemic. As a result, the academia, industry, and government sectors are working tightly together to develop and test a variety of vaccines at an unprecedented pace. In this notebook I want to present an overview of vacciantion progress in the world and answer following questions during the road:

    What vaccines are used and in which countries?
    What country is vaccinated more people?
    What country is fully vaccinated more people?
    What country is vaccinated a larger percent from its population?
    What country is fully vaccinated a larger percent from its population?
